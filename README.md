This program is fire escape simulation that takes user's inputs of floor size, number of people and number of exit, and provide with the most efficient plan for everyone to approach the closest exit and escape in the shortest period of time. The simulation can be visulised, so user can see how people are moving at each time point.

Some restrictions were took into considertaion to simulate the real life as much as possible. The restritions includes:
1. No one can move to the same spot at any time
2. There are walls locate in the middle of floor so may impede people's move

An interface has also been developed, so it can easlily collect information from user in a more frinendly fasion. The result will be printed out in the console.

The classes used in the program includes:
Exit
Person
FloorPlan
Planner
Simulation 
SafyMapyApp (Interface)

We also performed JUnit test when necessary to make sure the program is running appropriately.
